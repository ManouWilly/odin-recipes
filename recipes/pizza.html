    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is always good for you! In this article, we'll show you how you can also cook the perfect 
        "some kind of Neapolitan" vegan pizza at home.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>105ml water (lukewarm)</li>
        <li>175 g Weizenmehl Type 00 (z. B. Caputo Cuoco)</li>
        <li>0 6 g dry yeast (or 1.8 g fresh yeast)</li>
        <li>3.6 grams of salt</li>
        <li>5 grams of olive oil</li>
        <li>Farine (semoule de bl√© dur ou polenta pour saupoudrer le plan de travail)</li>
        <li>5 grams of basil</li>
        <li>70g vegan mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the water in a large bowl, add the flour, yeast, salt, olive oil and sugar then knead in a food processor 
                or by hand for 10 minutes to form a homogeneous and not too sticky dough. Cover the bowl and let stand for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you have prepared several portions, divide the dough into dough pieces of about 280 g, form 
                balls and round them. Brush lightly with olive oil, place in metal or plastic containers with lids and let 
                rise in the refrigerator for a minimum of 8 hours and a maximum of 5-7 days.</li>
            <li>Take out of the refrigerator about 1 hour before cooking.</li>
            <li>Crush the peeled tomatoes with your hands. Finely grate the garlic and stir it 
                into the tomato sauce with the salt and grated oregano. Reserve until further use.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
